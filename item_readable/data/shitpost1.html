		<h4><b>I began to have fantasies of becoming very powerful and stopping everyone from having sex.</b></h4>
		<p>I wanted to take their sex away from them, just like they took it away from me. I saw sex as an evil and barbaric act, all because I was unable to have it. This was the major turning point. My anger made me stronger inside. This was when I formed my ideas that sex should be outlawed. It is the only way to make the world a fair and just place. If I can’t have it, I will destroy it.</p>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<p>That’s the conclusion I came to, right then and there.</p>
