## Tweaks

###### Constants

ENVIRO_DRY_INCREMENT is tripled, meaning clothes will dry 3x faster. Keep in mind that because the base value is really low this modification is barely noticable. Just instead of having 'drenched' clothing after walking around for 2 hours you'll have 'soaked' or maybe 'wet'. It is still much better to dry your clothes next to a fire but if you have 'damp' or 'wet' attire they might dry up by themselves after 30-60 min, removing the annoying wetness icon.</br>
Worn clothes give you the same insulation as pristine ones. I just find it annoying that some attire has best insulation when pristine but only high when in worn condition.</br>
The character now uses half the energy/water when walking or jogging. Right now even if you're low on food it's still worth it to sprint around trying to find food (especially since the update that makes it so you loose much less health when starving) because even though you're burning more calories you also get that much further. This modification helps players low on food/water, just don't sprint if you don't want to starve.
